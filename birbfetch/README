Birbfetch is a tiny neofetch-like program I wrote for my DIY Linux based
operating system MCL (Minki's Crappy Linux).
This script is designed to work on very old versions of the bash interpreter
and can use the busybox internal free command without parameters to parse
RAM data. This allows it to operate on embedded systems without additional
dependencies. Included is also an ASCII art image of MCLs logo.

If anyone wants to continue the development of this program, feel free to copy
and improve it. Just keep in mind to mention me as the original creator.
